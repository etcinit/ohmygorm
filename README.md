Some setup helpers for [Gorm](https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm) using [Confer](https://github.com/jacobstr/confer)

[![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/f6e8411f910bebbf61daec4e5234db19/m "wercker status")](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/f6e8411f910bebbf61daec4e5234db19)

## Now featuringâ„¢:

- Using Confer to gather database settings
- Designed for one connection per app (for now)
- MySQL and SQLite drivers
- Built-in support for `facebookgo/inject`

## Maybe one day:

- PostgreSQL driver
